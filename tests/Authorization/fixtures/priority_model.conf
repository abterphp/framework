# A request must contain a subject, an object, and an action

[policy_definition]
# A policy is made up of a subject, an object, an action, and an effect
p = sub, obj, act, eft

[role_definition]
# A group consists of two pieces: a user and a role

[policy_effect]
# Action will be allowed if the highest priority policy rule allows it, denied otherwise

[matchers]
# Match only if the request and policy rule subject belong to the same group and
# the request and resource ojbects and actions are the same
#
# In practice this means that if we have a rule to
# A. Allow Admins To Pick Mushrooms with a priority of 10
# B. Deny Alice To Pick Mushrooms with a priority of 2
# Then Alice will not be allowed to Pick Mushrooms by default, but will be when promoted to have admin rights
